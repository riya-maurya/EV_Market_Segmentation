# 🚗 Market Segmentation on EV Charging Patterns using Machine Learning

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging data to identify customer segments based on charging behavior, energy usage, and environmental factors using unsupervised machine learning.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on EV charging patterns
- Apply K-Means clustering for segmentation
- Visualize findings with graphs like the Elbow Curve, Silhouette Score, PCA, and Heatmap
- Derive actionable insights for EV infrastructure or marketing strategies

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing & Scaling
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Elbow Method
- Silhouette Score Plot
- PCA 2D Scatter Plot
- Heatmap of Cluster-Wise Feature Averages

## 📁 Files Included
- `ev_charging_patterns.csv` — Dataset
- `EV_Market_Segmentation.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook
- `report.pdf` — Final project report

## 📈 Insights
The dataset was segmented into 5 unique clusters based on charging behavior. Cluster 0 mostly represented short city rides with high-speed chargers, while Cluster 2 and 4 showed long-distance users. Cluster 3 reflected high-cost usage in warm climates, likely commercial EVs. These insights are useful to target EV infrastructure strategies and user-specific services
